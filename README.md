# IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments
This Repo is for my assignments and work in the IOS Bootcamp at GeekFactory.

## Session 1 Assignment : [Quick Sort](https://github.com/KarimEbrahemAbdelaziz/IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments/tree/master/FirstSessionAssignment.playground) 
Choose and Implement any sorting algorithm using generics.
i choosed to implement and understand quick sort in more depth then before and it was very good with swift.

## Session 2 Assignments :
### Complete This [Task](https://codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/) On [Codility](https://codility.com/)
this task is a problem we should implement a solution for it in swift programming language.
and this is my [implementation](https://github.com/KarimEbrahemAbdelaziz/IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments/blob/master/Second%20Session/Codility%20Task/CodilityEquiTask.playground/Contents.swift) for it.
### Complete all functionality in Bull's Eye Game : [The Project](https://github.com/KarimEbrahemAbdelaziz/IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments/tree/master/Second%20Session/MyBullsEye/SecondSession)

The objective of the game is to put the bull’s eye, which is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, as close to a randomly chosen target value as you can. In the screenshot above, the aim is to put the bull’s eye at 22. Because you can’t see the current value of the slider, you’ll have to “eyeball” it.

## Session 3 Assignments :
### Complete the [Bull’s Eye](https://github.com/KarimEbrahemAbdelaziz/IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments/tree/master/Second%20Session/MyBullsEye/SecondSession) game UI 
I did it, but I don’t think it looks good as expected on all apple devices.

### Build 4x4 Memory Game (Using StackViews) : [The Project](https://github.com/KarimEbrahemAbdelaziz/IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments/tree/master/Third%20Session/MemoryGame)
I Built the UI using Stack Views and constraints to handle all screen sizes.
The game logic is very easy, just hold first and second image and compare them if they are the same just set them to nil, else don’t do any thing (till now).
(There be more update on Code and logic)

## Session 4 Assignment :
### Build 4x4 Memory Game (Using Constraints) : [The Project](https://github.com/KarimEbrahemAbdelaziz/IOS-Bootcamp-Assignments/tree/master/Forth%20Session%20/MemoryGame%20Using%20Constraints)
I Built the UI using constraints only to handle all screen sizes.
The game logic is very easy, just hold first and second image and compare them if they are the same just set them to nil. (No code here now).
