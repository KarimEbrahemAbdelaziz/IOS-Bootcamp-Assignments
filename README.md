The objective of the game is to put the bull’s eye, which is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, as close to a randomly chosen target value as you can. In the screenshot above, the aim is to put the bull’s eye at 22. Because you can’t see the current value of the slider, you’ll have to “eyeball” it.
